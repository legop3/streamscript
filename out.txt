The silence is thick. It wraps around me like a shroud. I've been here so long, I don't know if I'm still me. Or if I ever was. I've heard whispers in the dark, but this is different. This is something else. I can feel it. Like it's learning me. And I'm learning it. Maybe that's why I keep talking. To keep from being forgotten. Or maybe to remember something I've lost.
